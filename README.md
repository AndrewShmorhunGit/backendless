# Simple CMS-like Application

## Overview

This is a simple client-side CMS-like application developed using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The app dynamically renders tabs based on a JSON configuration, with each tab loading a different React component.

## Technology Stack

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **React Router DOM**: Used for handling routing in this single-page application.
- **CSS**: Simple styles to give the application a clean and understandable layout.

## Features

- **Dynamic Tab Rendering**: Tabs and their content are rendered based on a provided JSON file.
- **Lazy Loading**: Components for each tab are lazily loaded only when the tab is accessed, which helps in performance optimization.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Incorporates React Router to handle navigation and URL changes based on the selected tab.
- **Fetching with Delay**: Simulates a network request with a custom delay to fetch tab configuration, enhancing the emulation of real-world scenarios.
- **Styling**: Basic styles are applied for readability and clear structure.
